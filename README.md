# rocketry
A Python repository for rocketry simulation.
Currently this project is attempting to create a functional calculator of the work done by a water powered rocket.
It now also includes basic forces calculation programs such as air resistance and gravity calculators. I am now going to include functionality that will allow for the optimisation of the gas used.
